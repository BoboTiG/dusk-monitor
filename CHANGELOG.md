# 1.0.0

- Remove the need for SSH, making the project really safe by not touching the node at all.
- Remove the `<DATA_DIR>/provisioner.txt` file: now using a `<DATA_DIR>/config.json` file to store this information in addition to other parameters.
- Remove the `listen.py` file, no more needed.
- Remove the `websockets` module requirement.
- Replace the `niquests` module for `requests`.
